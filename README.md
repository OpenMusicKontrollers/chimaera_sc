# Open Music Kontrollers
## SuperCollider repository

### Install

To install the _Chimaera_ extension, simply copy this folder into your
SuperCollider user extension directory.

	sc3> Platform.userExtensionDir.postln;

or alternatively into the system-wide extension directory. 

	sc3> Platform.systemExtensionDir.postln;

### Usage

There are a bunch of examples in the _ignore_ directory which show the usage of
the extension classes. Run and adapt them to your needs.
